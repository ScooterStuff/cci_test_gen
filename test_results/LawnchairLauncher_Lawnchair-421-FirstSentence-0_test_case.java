This test case is designed to test the old behavior of the `findCellForSpan` method. It includes edge cases where the old behavior is expected to pass but should fail in the new implementation due to changes. The test case does not test new behavior explicitly, but it does consider how the new implementation diverges from the old behavior. The focus of the test is on detecting missing or altered functionality based on the old comment.
