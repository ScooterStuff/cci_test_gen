```java

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class SchemaWriterTest {

    @Test
    public void testWriteSchemaOldBehavior() throws Exception {
        // Create a new instance of the class containing the method to be tested
        SchemaWriter writer = new SchemaWriter();

        // Create a mock Types object
        Types mockTypes = new Types();

        // Call the old writeSchema method
        boolean result = writer.writeSchema(mockTypes);

        // Assert that the method returns false, as per the old implementation
        assertFalse("writeSchema should return false", result);

        // Now, let's test the new implementation with a non-array type, which should fail
        // because the new implementation only handles array types
        Class nonArrayType = String.class;
        try {
            Element element = writer.writeSchema(nonArrayType, mockTypes);
            fail("writeSchema should throw an exception when called with a non-array type");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Expected exception
        }
    }
}
```
Please note that this test case assumes the existence of a `Types` class and a `SchemaWriter` class. The `Types` class is expected to have a no-argument constructor and the `SchemaWriter` class is expected to have the old and new `writeSchema` methods. The test case may need to be adjusted based on the actual classes and methods in your codebase.
